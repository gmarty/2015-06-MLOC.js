### Interoperability

Note:
I want to run my physical software on my devices, whatever their OS is.
Interoperability is lawful in France.

#### Proprietary = censorship

Note:
There's no reason why I shouldn't be able to play a software on an OS it wasn't
designed for.
That's like censorship! This is unacceptable!
I'm a Linux user. Sony won't make me switch to Windows or Mac to play Blu-ray discs.
Proprietary excludes de facto some groups of people.
Proprietary = discrimination.

### Conservation purposes

Note:
Digital formats don't have to go the same fate than non-digital formats.

Note:
Think about [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/)
They're doing a great job in this field.
Our common dream = eradicate digital formats obsolescence.

### The web is omnipresent

Note:
The web is the lingua franca of modern computers.
If it runs on the web, it runs everywhere.
There are web only OSes.

### The web is omnipotent

Note:
The web is interactive, plays audio/video, generates images/video, interacts with peripherals (mouse, keyboard, touch screen, VR...), stores information.
