## Compiling to the web is not as hard as you think

---

Understand the logic

---

Reuse the web technologies

Note:
Map foreign concepts (display, sounds, input...) to web features.
Don't try to reimplement them (e.g. images, not canvas).

---

Examples of things to compile to the web:

* Video game console (SNES, PSX...)
* Blu-ray discs
* Native apps and games (Android, iOS)
